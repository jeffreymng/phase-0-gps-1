##Jeffrey Ng - Reflection
**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

The Git concepts I came across most that I struggled with were merge conflicts and what I should use git fetch and git merge for.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Both of these concepts were clarified for me by Gary (*especially using git merge and git fetch*) and actually being able to see how a merge conflict happened really helped me to understand how a merge conflict occurs. Gary's explanation on how git fetch is used to distinguish differences between Github and the local Git repository and pull branches was also a huge help as I didn't understand that before this.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Since I didn't have a pair, I asked Gary a lot of questions about using git merge/fetch as well as about syntax for files. For example, I was trying to add and commit the readme file but was not capitalizing it correctly as

    git add README.md
Instead, I was using

    git add readme.md
I didn't realize that capitalization mattered but this was cleared up by Gary.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

The syntax of files still confuses me a little bit since I am able to navigate through folders and open files while ignoring capitalization but cannot add or commit without using proper capitalization, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I did not have someone to pair with, but Gary was a huge help to me and he answered all of my questions.
